# Pyramid Plunder Counter
This plugin will display how many golden chests and sarcophagi you have sucessfully looted in your session. You are only eligible for a pharaoh's sceptre if you successfully looted a chest or sarcophagus. You know that you have been successful when no npc spawned while you were looting.
